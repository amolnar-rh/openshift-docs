toc::[]

You can upgrade a fleet of managed {sno} clusters with the image-based upgrade.
The image-based upgrade allows you to skip several minor releases and it is faster than the standard upgrade method.
The image-based upgrade uses custom images that are specific to the hardware platform that a fleet of clusters is running on. Each different hardware platform requires a separate custom image.

The image-based upgrade has the following five phases:

* Preparation phase
* Pre-upgrade / Backup phase
* Upgrade phase
* (Optional) Rollback phase
* Verification phase
