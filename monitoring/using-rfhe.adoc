== About Redfish hardware events

{product-title} enables your monitoring services to consume cloud-native events from Redfish hardware event-capable equipment. The Redfish service publishes events on a node and transmits them on an advanced message queue to your subscribing applications.

Redfish hardware events are based on the open Redfish standard that is developed under the guidance of the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF). Redfish provides a secure industry-standard protocol with a REST API. The protocol is used for the management of distributed, converged or software-defined resources and infrastructure.

[NOTE]
====
Redfish hardware events work only with Redfish-capable devices on OpenShift single-node clusters provisioned on baremetal infrastructure.
====

The hardware-related events published through Redfish to monitoring applications may include:

* Breaches of temperature limits
* Server status
* Fan status

Application developers can use the Redfish hardware events API to get log updates on errors that have or could occur in a distributed system.

You can use the {product-title} console to install the Redfish hardware event service by deploying the Operator and subscribing to the service. The Operator manages the lifecycle of the event service.

== Subscribing to Redfish BMC hardware events for a cluster node

As a cluster administrator, you can subscribe to Redfish BMC events generated on a node in your cluster by creating a `BMCEventSubscription` custom resource (CR) for the node, creating a `HardwareEvent` CR for the event, and a `Secret` CR for the BMC.
