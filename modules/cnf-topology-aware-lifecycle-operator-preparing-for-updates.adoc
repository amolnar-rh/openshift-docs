= End-to-end procedures for updating clusters in a disconnected environment


If you have deployed spoke clusters with distributed unit (DU) profiles using the GitOps ZTP with Topology Aware Lifecycle Operator pipeline described in "Deploying distributed units at scale in a disconnected environment", this procedure tells you how to upgrade your spoke clusters and Operators.

[id="talo-platform-prepare-for-update_{context}"]
== Preparing for the updates

If both the hub and the spoke clusters are running {product-title} 4.9, you need to update ZTP from version 4.9 to 4.10. If {product-title} 4.10 is used, you can set up the environment.

[id="talo-platform-prepare-for-update-env-setup_{context}"]
== Setting up the environment

If you deployed ZTP in a disconnected environment as instructed in the "Preparing the disconnected environment" section in "Deploying distributed units at scale in a disconnected environment", you need to do the following steps before TALO can successfully perform update operations:

TALO can perform both platform and Operator updates:

* For platform updates, you have to do the following:
+
. Mirror the desired {product-title} image repository. For more information about how to mirror an image repository, see the "Mirroring the OpenShift Container Platform image repository" section.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The `imageContentSources` section, which can be retrieved with the `oc adm release mirror` command, needs to be saved for platform updates.
For example, this is the output of the `imageContentSources` which contains the information of your mirrors:

[source,terminal]
----
imageContentSources:
 - mirrors:
   - mirror-ocp-registry.ibmcloud.io.cpak:5000/openshift-release-dev/openshift4
   source: quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release
 - mirrors:
   - mirror-ocp-registry.ibmcloud.io.cpak:5000/openshift-release-dev/openshift4
   source: quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-v4.0-art-dev

. Prepare the update graph. You have two options to prepare the update graph:

.. Use the OpenShift Update Service.
+
For more information about how to set up the graph on the hub cluster, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.4/html/clusters/managing-your-clusters#build-the-graph-data-init-container[Build the graph data init container].

* Make a local copy of the upstream graph. Host the update graph on an `http` or `https` server in the disconnected environment that has access to the spoke cluster. To download the update graph, use the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ curl -s https://api.openshift.com/api/upgrades_info/v1/graph?channel=stable-4.10 -o ~/upgrade-graph_stable-4.10
----

* For Operator updates, you must perform the following tasks:
+
. Mirror the desired index image, the bundle images, and all the Operator images that are referenced in the bundle images.
+
For more information about how to mirror images, see the "Preparing the disconnected environment" section.
