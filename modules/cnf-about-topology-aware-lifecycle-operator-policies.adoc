= About managed policies used with Topology Aware Lifecycle Operator (TALO)

The TALO uses {rh-rhacm} policies for cluster updates.

The TALO can be used to manage the rollout of any policy CR where the `remediationAction` field is set to `inform`. 
Supported use cases include the following:

* Manual user creation of policy CRs 
* Automatically generated policies from the `PolicyGenTemplate` custom resource definition (CRD)

For policies that update an Operator subscription with manual approval, the TALO provides additional functionality that approves the installation of the updated Operator.

For more information about managed policies, see link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.4/html-single/governance/index#policy-overview[Policy Overview] in the {rh-rhacm} documentation.

For more information about the `PolicyGenTemplate` CRD, see the "About the PolicyGenTemplate" section in "Deploying distributed units at scale in a disconnected environment".
