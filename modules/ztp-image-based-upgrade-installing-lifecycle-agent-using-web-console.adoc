= Installing the {lcao} by using the web console

You can use the {product-title} web console to install the {lcao} from the 4.15 Operator catalog on both the seed and target cluster.

.Prerequisites

* Log in as a user with `cluster-admin` privileges.

.Procedure

. In the {product-title} web console, navigate to *Operators* -> *OperatorHub*.
. Search for the *{lcao}* from the list of available Operators, and then click *Install*.
. Keep the default selection of *Installation mode* ["All namespaces on the cluster (default)"] and *Installed Namespace* ("openshift-operators") to ensure that the Operator is installed properly.
. Click *Install*.

.Verification

To confirm that the installation is successful:

. Navigate to the *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* page.
. Check that the Operator is installed in the `All Namespaces` namespace and its status is `Succeeded`.

If the Operator is not installed successfully:

. Navigate to the *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* page and inspect the `Status` column for any errors or failures.
. Navigate to the *Workloads* -> *Pods* page and check the logs in any containers in the `lifecycle-agent-controller-manager` pod that are reporting issues.
