.Prerequisites

. operator-sdk <https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/installation/>
. kustomize <https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/releases>
. opm <https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-registry/releases>
. Having the ClusterDeployment CRD installed is a prerequisite.
. Install Hive, if it has not already been installed.

[source,terminal]

$ cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: hive-operator

.Procedure

. Build the operator bundle (optional)

For development and testing purposes it may be beneficial to build the operator
bundle and index images.
If you don't __need__ to build it, skip to
[Deploying the Operator](#deploying-the-operator).

Build the bundle as follows:

[source,terminal]
----
$ export BUNDLE_IMAGE=quay.io/${QUAY_NAMESPACE}/assisted-service-operator-bundle:${TAG}
skipper make operator-bundle-build
----

[NOTE]
====
It is possible to run `make` without using Skipper.
In such a scenario all the required dependencies can be installed using the [setup_env.sh script](../hack/setup_env.sh).
====

. Create the assisted-installer namespace

The operator must be deployed to the assisted-installer namespace.
Create the namespace as follows:

[source,terminal]
----
$ cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: assisted-installer
  labels:
    name: assisted-installer
EOF
----

Install Hive, if it has not already been installed.

[source,terminal]
----
$ cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: hive-operator
  namespace: openshift-operators
spec:
  channel: alpha
  installPlanApproval: Automatic
  name: hive-operator
  source: community-operators
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
EOF
----

. Deploy the operator using the operator-sdk as shown:

[source,terminal]
----
$ operator-sdk run bundle \
  --namespace assisted-installer \
  ${BUNDLE_IMAGE:-quay.io/edge-infrastructure/assisted-service-operator-bundle:latest}
----

. Verify that the `infrastructure-operator` deployment is running in the `assisted-installer` namespace as follows:

[source,terminal]
----
$
----

. Use `operator-sdkl cleanup` as follows to remove the operator when installed via `operator-sdk run`:

[source,terminal]
----
$ operator-sdk cleanup --namespace assisted-installer assisted-service-operator
----

. Create an AgentServiceConfig Resource

The Assisted Service is deployed by creating an `AgentServiceConfig`.
Specify the `databaseStorage` and `filesystemStorage` to be used as follows:

[source,terminal]
----
$ cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
apiVersion: agent-install.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: AgentServiceConfig
metadata:
  name: agent
spec:
  databaseStorage:
    accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 10Gi
  filesystemStorage:
    accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 20Gi
  imageStorage:
    accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 10Gi
EOF
----

. Configuring the Assisted Service Deployment

The operator subscription can be used to configure the images used in the assisted-service deployment and the installer controller agent images used by
the assisted-service.

[source,terminal]
----
$ cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: assisted-service-operator
  namespace: assisted-installer
spec:
  config:
    env:
      - name: SERVICE_IMAGE
        value: ${SERVICE_IMAGE}
      - name: DATABASE_IMAGE
        value: ${DATABASE_IMAGE}
      - name: AGENT_IMAGE
        value: ${AGENT_IMAGE}
      - name: CONTROLLER_IMAGE
        value: ${CONTROLLER_IMAGE}
      - name: INSTALLER_IMAGE
        value: ${INSTALLER_IMAGE}
EOF
----

[NOTE]
====
The default channel for the assisted-service-operator package, here and in [community-operators](https://github.com/operator-framework/community-operators/tree/master/community-operators/assisted-service-operator), is `"alpha"` so we do not include it in the Subscription.
====

. Specify operator system image location

Locations of OS Images to be used when generating the discovery ISOs for different OpenShift versions can be specified via the `osImages` field on the `AgentServiceConfig`.

[source,terminal]
----
$ apiVersion: agent-install.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: AgentServiceConfig
metadata:
 name: agent
spec:
  databaseStorage:
    accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 10Gi
  filesystemStorage:
    accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 20Gi
  imageStorage:
    accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 10Gi
  osImages:
    - openshiftVersion: "4.6"
      version: "46.82.202012051820-0"
      url: "https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/dependencies/rhcos/4.6/4.6.8/rhcos-4.6.8-x86_64-live.x86_64.iso"
      cpuArchitecture: "x86_64"
    - openshiftVersion: "4.7"
      version: "47.83.202103251640-0"
      url: "https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/dependencies/rhcos/4.7/4.7.7/rhcos-4.7.7-x86_64-live.x86_64.iso"
      cpuArchitecture: "x86_64"
    - openshiftVersion: "4.8"
      version: "47.83.202103251640-0"
      url: "https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/dependencies/rhcos/4.7/4.7.7/rhcos-4.7.7-x86_64-live.x86_64.iso"
      cpuArchitecture: "x86_64"
----

. Create a ConfigMap in the assisted-installer namespace:

Create a `ConfigMap` in the `assisted-installer` namespace as follows:

[source,terminal]
----
$ cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-assisted-service-config
  namespace: assisted-installer
data:
  LOG_LEVEL: "debug"
EOF
----

. Specify ConfigMap environment variables

Specify a ConfigMap to be mounted into the assisted-service container as environment variables by adding the `"unsupported.agent-install.openshift.io/assisted-service-configmap"` annotation to the `AgentServiceConfig` specifying the name of the configmap to be used.
This ConfigMap must exist in the namespace where the operator is installed.
Add the annotation to the AgentServiceConfig as follows:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc annotate --overwrite AgentServiceConfig agent unsupported.agent-install.openshift.io/assisted-service-configmap=my-assisted-service-config
----

[NOTE]
====
After modifying content of the ConfigMap a new rollout of the Deployment has to be forced. This can be done with:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc rollout restart deployment/assisted-service -n assisted-installer
----
====

. Toggle TLS Check on Assisted Image Service
Toggle TLS checking from the Assisted Image Service by using the annotation `"unsupported.agent-install.openshift.io/assisted-image-service-skip-verify-tls"` on the AgentServiceConfig CR.
By default, this is set to `false`, meaning all TLS connections are verified.
When this annotation is set to `true`, the Assisted Image Service skips verifying TLS connections.
It affects the following services: downloading ISO images from a secure server.
Add the annotation to the AgentServiceConfig as follows:

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc annotate --overwrite AgentServiceConfig agent unsupported.agent-install.openshift.io/assisted-image-service-skip-verify-tls=true
----

. Configure the mirror registry

A ConfigMap can be used to configure assisted service to create installations using mirrored content.

The ConfigMap contains two keys:
`ca-bundle.crt`:: This key contains the contents of the certificate for accessing the mirror registry, if necessary.
It may be a certificate bundle and is defined as a single string.
`registries.conf`:: This key contains the contents of the `registries.conf` file that configures mappings to the mirror registry.

The mirror registry configuration changes the discovery image's ignition config, with `ca-bundle.crt` written out to `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/domain.crt` and with `registries.conf` written out to `/etc/containers/registries.conf`.

The configuration also changes the `install-config.yaml` file used to install a new cluster, with the contents of `ca-bundle.crt` added to `additionalTrustBundle` and with the registries defined `registries.conf` added to `imageContentSources` as mirrors.

The assisted service pod converts `registries.conf` into an `imageContentSourcesPolicy` file using the `--icsp` flag in some `oc adm` commands. These `oc adm` commands are run against the release image, which is executed from within the assisted service pod.

The `ca-bundle.crt` and `registries.conf` keys can be added individually or together.

[NOTE]
====
The ConfigMap should be installed in the same namespace as the infrastructure-operator (ie. `assisted-installer`).
====

  . To configure the mirror registry, first create and upload the ConfigMap containing the `ca-bundle.crt` and `registries.conf` keys:

[source,terminal]
----
$ cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: mirror-registry-config-map
  namespace: "assisted-installer"
  labels:
    app: assisted-service
data:
  ca-bundle.crt: |
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    certificate contents
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
  registries.conf: |
    unqualified-search-registries = ["registry.access.redhat.com", "docker.io"]
    [[registry]]
       prefix = ""
       location = "quay.io/edge-infrastructure"
mirror-by-digest-only = true
       [[registry.mirror]]
       location = "mirror1.registry.corp.com:5000/edge-infrastructure"
EOF
----

Registries listed in the `unqualified-search-registries` will be automatically added to an authentication ignore list (`PUBLIC_CONTAINER_REGISTRIES` environment variable) and will not be required by `assisted-service` when validating the pull secret.
Registries defined in the `registries.conf` must be scoped by repository and not by registry.

[NOTE]
====
`quay.io/edge-infrastructure` and `mirror1.registry.corp.com:5000/edge-infrastructure` are both scoped by the `edge-infrastructure` repository. This is a valid configuration.

Removing the repository `edge-infrastructure` from location is an invalid configuration, as it will not pass openshift-installer validation.
====

  . Set the `mirrorRegistryRef` in the spec of `AgentServiceConfig` to the name of uploaded `ConfigMap` as follows:

[source,terminal]
----
$ cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: agent-install.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: AgentServiceConfig
metadata:
  name: agent
spec:
  databaseStorage:
    accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 10Gi
  filesystemStorage:
    accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 20Gi
  imageStorage:
    accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 10Gi
  mirrorRegistryRef:
    name: mirror-registry-config-map
EOF
----

For more details on how to specify the CR, see [AgentServiceConfig CRD](https://github.com/openshift/assisted-service/blob/master/config/crd/bases/agent-install.openshift.io_agentserviceconfigs.yaml).

. Image Registries Without Authentication
`assisted-service` validates the [pull secret](hive-integration/kube-api-getting-started.md#2-create-a-pull-secret) provided for spoke cluster installation by making sure it contains the authentication information for every image registry used for installation.

Registries that don't require authentication can be listed under `spec.unauthenticatedRegistries` in the `AgentServiceConfig` resource.
Any registry on this list is not required to have an entry in the pull secret validated by the `assisted-service`.

[source,terminal]
----
$ apiVersion: agent-install.openshift.io/v1beta1
kind: AgentServiceConfig
metadata:
  name: agent
spec:
  unauthenticatedRegistries:
  - example.registry.com
  - example.registry2.com
  ...
----

[NOTE]
====
[Mirror registries](#mirror-registry-configuration) will automatically be added to the ignore list and does need not to be added under `spec.unauthenticatedRegistries`.
Specifying the `PUBLIC_CONTAINER_REGISTRIES` environment variable in the [ConfigMap override](#specifying-environmental-variables-via-configmap) is still supported and will completely overwrite the list to whatever is in the override.
