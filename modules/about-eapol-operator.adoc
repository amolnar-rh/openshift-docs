= About the {eapol}

With {eapol}, you can configure the authentication mechanism to allow any {product-title} server to be an authentication endpoint.
The Operator utilizes the 802.1x security protocol and the `hostapd` daemon as the authenticator.

You can configure the type of traffic that you allow through the physical devices connected to the network.

== About the 802.1x security protocol

The 802.1X security protocol provides a framework for authentication between a client device, an authenticator, and an authentication server.
This framework ensures that only authorized devices can access the network.

With {eapol}, there is no intermediary authenticator device, such as a switch or a wireless access point.
Instead, the authenticator resides on the physical function (PF) of the authentication server's NIC.
This is useful if you want to create a direct connection between the client device and authentication server.

When a client device tries to connect to the network, the authentication server checks whether the client device is authorized to connect.
When an unauthorized client device connects to the server, only PTP traffic is allowed on unauthorized devices.
All other traffic is blocked.
