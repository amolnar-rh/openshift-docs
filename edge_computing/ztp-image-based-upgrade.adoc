toc::[]

From {product-title} 4.14.7, the {lcao} 4.15 provides you with an alternative way to upgrade the platform version of a {sno} cluster.
The image-based upgrade is faster than the standard upgrade method and allows you to directly upgrade from {product-title} <4.y> to <4.y+2>, and <4.y.z> to <4.y.z+n>.
