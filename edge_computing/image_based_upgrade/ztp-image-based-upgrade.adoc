= Performing an image-based upgrade for {sno} clusters with GitOps ZTP

:context: ztp-image-based-upgrade

toc::[]

You can upgrade your managed {sno} cluster with the image-based upgrade through GitOps ZTP.

[IMPORTANT]
====
During the Developer Preview of this feature, when upgrading a cluster, any custom trusted certificates configured on the cluster will be lost. As a temporary workaround, to preserve these certificates, you must use a seed image from a seed cluster that trusts the certificates.
