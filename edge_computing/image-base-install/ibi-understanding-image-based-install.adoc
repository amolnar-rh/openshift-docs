Image-based installations streamline the deployment process for {sno} clusters by significantly reducing installation and deployment times.

This approach enables the preinstallation of configured and validated instances of {sno} on target hosts. These preinstalled hosts can be rapidly reconfigured and deployed at the far edge of the network, including in disconnected environments, with minimal intervention.

[NOTE]
====
To deploy a managed cluster using an imaged-based approach in combination with {ztp-first}, you can use the SiteConfig Operator. For more information about the SiteConfig Operator, see link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/[Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes].

== Overview of an image-based installation and deployment for {sno} clusters

Service providers continue to deploy their infrastructure at the far edge of the network. This presents challenges in low bandwidth, high latency environments, or disconnected environments, in terms of the cost, time, and expertise needed to install and deploy {sno} clusters.

An image-based approach to installing and deploying {sno} clusters at the far edge of the network overcomes these challenges by separating the installation and deployment stages.

Imaged-based installation::
Using an image-based installation, you can preinstall multiple hosts with {sno} at a central site, such as a service depot or a factory. You can also validate the base configuration for these hosts and leverage the image-based approach to perform reproducible factory installs at scale by using a single container image.

Image-based deployment::
The preinstalled and validated hosts are shipped to a remote site where they can be rapidly reconfigured and deployed in a matter of minutes by using a configuration image.

[NOTE]
====
To manually deploy a preinstalled host, you must define an `ImageBasedConfig` resource and an installation manifest, and provide these as inputs to the `openshift-install` installation program. For more information see _Deploying a {sno} cluster using the {product-title} installation program_.

The instructions for preinstalling a host are the same whether you deploy the host by using the {product-title} installation program or the IBI Operator.

=== Image-based installation for {sno} clusters
Using the {lcao}, you can generate an OCI container image that encapsulates an instance of a {sno} cluster. This image is derived from a dedicated cluster that you can configure with the target {product-title} version.  

You can reference this image in a live installation ISO to consistently preinstall configured and validated instances of {sno} to multiple hosts. This approach enables the preparation of hosts at a central location, for example in a factory or service depot, before shipping the preinstalled hosts to a remote site for rapid reconfiguration and deployment. 

The following is a high-level overview of the image-based installation process:

* Generate an image from a {sno} cluster.
* Use the {product-title} installation program to embed the seed image URL, and other installation artifacts, in a live installation ISO.
* Start the host using the live installation ISO to preinstall the host. 
+
During this process, the {product-title} installation program installs {op-system-first} to the disk, pulls the image you generated, and precaches release container images to the disk.

* When the installation completes, the host is ready to ship to the remote site for rapid reconfiguration and deployment.

=== Image-based deployment for {sno} clusters

You can use an image-based deployment for {sno} clusters.

Managed {sno} cluster deployment::

{rh-rhacm-first} and the multicluster engine for Kubernetes operator (MCE) use a hub-and-spoke architecture to manage and deploy {sno} clusters across multiple sites. Using this approach, the hub cluster serves as a central control plane that manages the spoke clusters, which are often remote {sno} clusters deployed at the far edge of the network.
+
You can define the site-specific configuration resources for an image-based deployment in the hub cluster. The Image Based Install (IBI) Operator uses these configuration resources to reconfigure the preinstalled host at the remote site and deploy the host as a managed {sno} cluster. This approach is especially beneficial for telecommunications providers and other service providers with extensive, distributed infrastructures, where an end-to-end installation at the remote site would be time-consuming and costly.
+
The following is a high-level overview of the image-based deployment process for hosts preinstalled with an imaged-based installation:
+
* Define the site-specific configuration resources for the preinstalled host in the hub cluster.
* Apply these resources in the hub cluster. This initiates the deployment process.
* The IBI Operator creates a configuration ISO.
* The IBI Operator boots the target preinstalled host with the configuration ISO attached.
* The host mounts the configuration ISO and begins the reconfiguration process.
* When the reconfiguration completes, the {sno} cluster is ready.
+
As the host is already preinstalled using an image-based installation, a technician can reconfigure and deploy the host in a matter of minutes.

{sno} cluster deployment::

For clusters not managed by {rh-rhacm} or MCE, you can use the {product-title} installation program to configure and deploy a host that you preinstalled with an image-based installation. To configure the target host with site-specific details, you must create the following resources:

* The `install-config.yaml` installation manifest.

* The `image-based-config.yaml` manifest.

The `openshift-install` installation program consumes these resources to generate a configuration ISO that you can attach to your preinstalled target host and complete the deployment.

== Image-based installation and deployment key components

The following content describes key components in image-based installation and deployments.

Seed image:: A seed image is an OCI container image generated from a dedicated cluster with the target {product-title} version. 

Seed cluster:: A seed cluster is a dedicated {sno} cluster that you use to create a seed image and is deployed with the target {product-title} version.

{lcao}:: In image-based installations, you can use the {lcao} to generate a seed image, embed the seed image URL in a live installation ISO, and reconfigure the host during a deployment at a remote site.

Image Based Install (IBI) Operator:: When you deploy managed clusters, the IBI Operator creates a configuration ISO from the site-specific resources you define in the hub cluster, and attaches the configuration ISO to the preinstalled host by using a bare-metal provisioning service.

{product-title} installation program:: You can use the `openshift-install` installation program to manually create a configuration ISO. Attach the configuration ISO to a preinstalled host to complete the deployment.
